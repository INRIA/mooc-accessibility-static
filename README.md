# MOOC Accessibility website

Source code for the [MOOC Accessibility website](https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr).

## Why

Because manually managing configurations is a hassle. If we need to update all the configurations at once, this should be easy to do.

## What

This website hosts:

1. HTML files to consume the Accessibilité Numérique MOOC in a standalone fashion.
2. HTML files to be embed for 3rd party platforms such as [FUN](https://www.fun-mooc.fr).

## How

This website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) `v0.57`. [Installing Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) is required to build the static files.

No other dependencies are required, but if you want to test website on you local machine, you need to:

1. Download Aiana player target version; it should be the same as the one in `.travis.yml` file.
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Rename the `manifest.yml` file to `data/scripts.yml`.
4. Move JavaScript files to `static/js/` directory.

This is automated by the CI provider ([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com)).

## Managing content

### Generating a new course content

```sh
hugo new course/<course_identifier>/index.md
```
