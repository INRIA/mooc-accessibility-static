# Inria Digital Accessibility MOOC Website

Inria Digital Accessibility MOOC website is the standalone version of the MOOC
that was hosted by [FUN](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/).  
It also contains web pages to be embed for 3rd party platforms such as
[FUN](https://www.fun-mooc.fr).

This website contains all the course resources (such as media, slides, or
subtitles). However, note that users will not be prompted with any survey nor
quiz.

It is available at the following url: <https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr/>

## How to Consume this MOOC

There are two ways to consume this MOOC.

### Browsing the Website

All the MOOC content is served at <https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr/> and is
free to browse. If you are just looking for plain content consuming, this is
probably what you are looking for.

### Embeding the MOOC

If you host your own website and you want to integrate a MOOC sequence to it,
the recommended way to do it is by using an `iframe`.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr/course/w1-s1/embed.html"
  class="mooc-iframe"
  scrolling="no"
  width="800"
  height="546"
/>
```

This integration is better suited when you do not want to host any of the player
files on your servers.

This is how FUN was integreting the MOOC to their platform without having to
bother about configuration or JavaScript integration to their code.

#### Note About Styles

To remove the `iframe` borders, you need to explicitely set a CSS rule for it:

```css
.mooc-iframe {
  border: 0;
}
```

#### Courtesy of Inria

Remember that when you embed this MOOC to your website, it consumes resources
provided by Inria.

If Inria encourages people to spread this MOOC, it does not charge anything for
this service. So please use it moderately, and be kind to notify us when you
embed it in a MOOC platform.

### Service-Level Agreement

Inria does not provide any formalized agreements to deliver a particular level
of service, please consider it as a best-effort model.

Unplanned outages and maintenance may happen without any notice, and Inria
cannot guarantee [the MOOC website](https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr/) uptime
nor performances.

If you plan on embedding the MOOC, you should keep that in mind.

## Development

This website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) `>v0.58.3`, which is
the only required software installation.
[Installing Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) is required in
order to build the static HTML files.

To test the website locally, you will also need to download the
[MOOC player](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player) assets that are not
included to this repository:

1. Download Aiana player release zip archive; it should be the same as the one
   specified in `PLAYER_VERSION` key in `.travis.yml` file.  
   Releases are listed on the
   [repository releases page](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player/releases).

2. Unzip the archive.

3. Move the `release/manifest.yml` file to `data/manifest.yml`.

4. Move the player JavaScript files to `static/js/`.

5. Move the `release/locales` folder to `static/`. These files are included in
   the player release archive since `v2.2.1`. If you target an earlier version,
   the files can be copy pasted from the player repository depending on
   targetted player version. For example, if you intend to use `v2.2.0`, you
   should download all files from
   [`v2.2.0` tree](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player/tree/v2.2.0/public/locales).

6. Run `hugo server`. This command will automatically reload the server when
   content is modified.

7. Go to `http://localhost:1313`.

## Managing Content

The ["Content Management"](https://gohugo.io/content-management/) section of the
Hugo documentation covers extensively how to manage content.

## How to Create a Release

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) is used as continuous integration platform.

Whenever a Git tag is pushed, Travis will perform all steps mentioned above and
build an archive containing the files for both staging and production
environments.

Releases can be found on
[the project release page](https://github.com/dashdashzako/mooc-accessibility-static/releases).

Note that there is a
[static link to the latest release](https://github.com/dashdashzako/mooc-accessibility-static/releases/latest)
which is used for website deployment.

### Release Commit

1. Create the release tag using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

   `git tag vX.X.X`

2. Push tags to the repository:

   `git push origin --tags`

3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` by moving the "Unreleased" section content to a new
   section containing the release tag.

4. Commit `CHANGELOG.md` updates.

### Manually Create a Release

If no continuous environment is provided, creating a release is still possible.
The `script` section of the `.travis.yml` file describes how to achieve this.

The following example will create a `./build` directory containing the files for
the production environment:

```sh
# example assumes `hugo` executable is available.
#
# target player tag is v2.2.3.

cd path/to/mooc-accessibility-static

# download player archive
curl -LO https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player/releases/download/v2.2.3/release.zip

# extract player files
unzip release.zip

# remove existing locales folder
rm -rf static/locales

# move player release locales to website assets
mv release/locales static/

# move player release manifest file to website data
mv release/manifest.yml data/manifest.yml

# move player release JavaScript files to website assets
mv release/*.js static/js/

echo "url: /api/logs" > data/logger.yml
echo "site_id: 100" > data/matomo.yml

hugo --destination build --gc --baseUrl https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr/

echo "env: prod" > build/prod/version.html
echo "tag: $(git describe --tags)" >> build/prod/version.html
echo "player: v2.2.3" >> build/prod/version.html
```

## MOOC Analytics

Two kinds of analytics will be measured as a users browse pages and use the MOOC
player. Both are optional, though they may help understanding usages and improve
the website, the MOOC content, and the player.

### Audience Analytics

Audience analytics helps understanding global usage of the website and gives
insights about users browsing context: screen resolution, browser, operating
systemâ€¦

Inria recommends using [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly Piwiki) to
collect the analytics, and this website uses the
[Inria on-premise instance](https://piwik.inria.fr/).

The Matomo `script` tag will be integrated on each page if a `data/matomo.yml`
file exists and has a `site_id` key.

For a local development environment, content of the file will be:

```yaml
site_id: '101'
```

The Matomo identifiers are:

- `100` for production
- `101` for staging

To require access to the website analytics, please contact any of the
administrators:

- [Pascal Guitton](pascal.guitton@inria.fr)
- [Julien Lelaurain](julien.lelaurain@inria.fr)

### Web Player Analytics

Player events help understand how users are interacting with the MOOC content.
They provide extensive details about the player state, but none about the user
triggering them.

Actions made by users will be pushed to a remote server only if its url is
provided. The logging endpoint can be specified within a `data/logger.yml` file
containing a `url` key.

For example, the `data/logger.yml` file could be:

```yaml
url: 'https://domain.com/path/to/write/logs'
```

To know more about web player actions, please refer to
[the player documentation](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player).
