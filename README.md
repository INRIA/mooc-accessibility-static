# MOOC Accessibility website

Source code for the [MOOC Accessibility website](https://mooc-accessibility.inria.fr).

## What

The built version of this static website will host:

1. HTML files to consume the Accessibilité Numérique MOOC in a standalone fashion.
2. HTML files to be embed for 3rd party platforms such as [FUN](https://www.fun-mooc.fr).

## Why

Because manually managing configurations is a hassle. If we need to update every courses configurations at once, this should be easy to do.

## How

This website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) `v0.58.3`. [Installing Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) is required to build the static HTML files.

All of this is completely automated by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) and will run every time a **tag** is pushed.

### Development

No other dependencies are required, but you need to download the player assets if you want to test website locally:

1. Download Aiana player release ZIP archive; it should be the same as the one specified in `PLAYER_VERSION` key in `.travis.yml` file.  
  Releases are listed on the [repository releases page](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player/releases).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Move the `release/manifest.yml` file to `data/manifest.yml`.
4. Move the player JavaScript files to `static/js/`.
5. Move the `release/locales` folder to `static/`.
  These files are included in the player release archive since `v2.2.1`. If you target an earlier version, the files can be copy pasted from the player repository depending on targetted player version. For example, if you intend to use `v2.2.0`, you should download all files from [`v2.2.0` tree](https://github.com/dashdashzako/aiana-player/tree/v2.2.0/public/locales).
6. Run `hugo`, or if you specify a specific serving URL, `hugo --baseUrl https://<hostname>.<ext>/`.

### Web Player Events

If you need to log player events, you will also have to create the `data/logger.yml` file:

```yaml
url: "custom logger url"
```

### Analytics

For pages analytics, the `data/matomo.yml` file is required:

```yaml
site_id: "101" # development identifier
```

## Managing content

### Generating a new course content

```sh
hugo new course/<course_identifier>/index.md
```
