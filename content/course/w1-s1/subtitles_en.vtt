00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.480
Welcome to this MOOC
on digital accessibility

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.120
that Helen and I
offer you.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.960
We will address several
aspects of accessibility

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.960
by talking about content,
design methods

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.200
and technology support.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.240
We will come back about
the precise content of this plan.

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.320
In this first week,
we will set the general framework,

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.120
the context of the disability
situation that we will talk about.

9
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.760
We will give you
a number of figures

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.680
of evolution of the concept
of handicap over time

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.600
and we will present
a definition.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.280
We will finish
this first week

13
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
by presenting the objectives
and course plan

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.040
when we have seen
this context and definition.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.920
In this first sequence,

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.240
I will address for the first
time the disability situation

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.880
and present figures at the global level

18
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.120
on the number of people
affected by this situation.

19
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.000
The first thing is
that this word of disability

20
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.800
covers many
different realities,

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.400
related to the cultural,
geographical and historical context.

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.480
The disability situation
is not perceived the same.

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.800
It can be seen
that in recent years,

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.240
the consideration
of disability has evolved,

25
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.200
with positive initiatives

26
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.880
that have had results.
But despite this evolution,

27
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.160
the consideration
is incomplete and unsatisfactory

28
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.280
in many places.

29
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.720
If we talk about disability,
let's start by reminding

30
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.160
that it can be acquired
at birth

31
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.440
or result of an illness
or an accident.

32
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
It can be scalable
and change over time.

33
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.880
It can be non-permanent,

34
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.720
so happen and disappear
after other types of events.

35
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040
It can,
for the elderly,

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.400
be cumulative,
with other disability situations.

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Note that disability
is often of three types of origin.

38
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.120
The first origin is
of sensory type

39
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.200
affecting the functions of perception
like sight and hearing.

40
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.280
It can be of motor origin
and we think immediately

41
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.400
of people
having difficulty to move,

42
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.320
but also, in the case of this MOOC
who will talk about computer science

43
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.560
–and this aspect is important–

44
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.320
people with reduced mobility

45
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.960
having difficulty in gesturing
with the hand and the fingers.

46
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.200
Finally,
third possible origin,

47
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.800
often called invisible
because it does not appear directly,

48
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.920
disorders of cognitive origin

49
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.840
affecting brain functions
such as attention or memory.

50
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.120
If we try to quantify
and count

51
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.280
people in the world
with disabilities,

52
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.680
it is estimated
that there are 1 billion people,

53
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720
according to WHO,

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.040
or 15% of the population concerned.

55
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.560
This figure is underestimated.

56
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.400
We will come back
to explain why.

57
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.320
The other characteristic
on which the experts agree

58
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.800
is to consider
this figure higher

59
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.880
because the progress of medicine
allows an aging population

60
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.800
and disability situations
at the end of life.

61
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.760
Another very important figure

62
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.200
to link to what
we are going to see is that

63
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.480
80% of people
with disabilities

64
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.720
live in
developing countries.

65
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.320
We see the relationship
between the disability situation

66
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.960
and the environment
in which the person will live,

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.800
either a rich country
or a poor country.

68
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.000
In countries with a life expectancy
greater than 70 years,

69
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.440
people will live on average
8 years with disabilities,

70
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600
more than 10% of their life.

71
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.120
We are all concerned
by this situation.

72
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.280
It is quite easy to find
disability figures,

73
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.200
but it is difficult
to make them consistent

74
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.240
and to be absolutely sure
of a count.

75
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.640
Why?
Several causes are possible.

76
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.960
The first is that at the global level,

77
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.040
the quality and nature of censuses vary.

78
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.000
The methods are not the same
from one country to another.

79
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.520
It is difficult to obtain easily
comparable figures.

80
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
2nd reason:
studies are piecemeal.

81
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.760
They concern only
one type of disability,

82
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.760
such as vision
or fine motor skills.

83
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It is difficult to compare
them and obtain a global vision.

84
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.560
Reason 3: Differences

85
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.520
between censuses and
declarations must be distinguished.

86
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.520
Censuses are conducted
by an agency

87
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.200
or independent body outside

88
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.120
the declaration of
the person with disabilities.

89
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.240
4th reason: the difference

90
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.400
between the functional aspects and
the activity limitations that result from them

91
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.800
and are objectively measurable,

92
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.920
subjective perceptions.

93
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.040
Comparing these figures,
there is a noticeable difference.

94
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.400
We note that this word disability

95
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.000
covers very different realities

96
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.760
and we see the need

97
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.360
to define terms, concepts,

98
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.920
to know what covers
the word disability.

99
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.400
Subsequently, we will
propose definitions

100
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.080
of frameworks or contexts

101
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.320
that will provide a definition.

102
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.960
It will not be the only definition,

103
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.040
but the one we will use and
which will be our common reference.
